<h3>items, inventory and mystery - 04/07/17</h3>

    While the <del>plank of wood</del> sword you have seen previously is quite formidabble it just wont do on its own. As a result of this I managed to construct a projectile based weapon, a magic staff which summons a ball of damage which propells itself across the level. 
    Little did i know the horrors that would await me when I first tried to get the charachter to swap between these 2 weapons.
    The sword no longer seemed able to pass its damage....  even though it was exactly the same as when it worked.
    This curse haunted me for 2 full days, what was wrong?
    Eventually it dawned on me, i must have changed something in the enemy to allow for the magic ball which the sword depended on, and I eventually found my culprit.
    <i> The <b>Is Trigger</b> checkbox. </i>
</p>

    It had been checked while I was using the sword, and I now found myself in despair as it need to be unchecked for my dreams to be fulfilled and my magical fireballs to be able to scorch into ashes all who stand before the mighty player of this game.
    Then came the revelation, the sword should manage its own problems.I left enemy <b>Is Trigger</b> unchecked. I changed the <b>Is Trigger</b> value on my sword prefab to checked, the sword worked. So did the projectiles.
    Hurrah!!

    Times were good but these gameobjects remained unworthy, for they were hardcoded directly into the inventory controller. And so they were purged.
    Next begins a new glorious era in which a master item list akin to a database will be referenced by the inventory controller, and players will be able to collect and change equippable items according to their own will.

    Construction has begun already with changes to the inventory controller and a snazzy but simple canvas UI to help players select their choices.  
    The loot is coming.

    Unity - Special Tip
    using UnityEngine.UI; this namespace allows you to directly reference UI elements such as buttons as objects in your c#.

<h3>chats and stats - 24/06/17</h3>
<p>
    For NPC interacion i built a dialogue manager which sends lines of dialogue to a canvas UI which contains a button to continue/end the conversation. The NPC calls up an instance of the dialogue manager when its interact method is called and the precise lines of text to be displayed are be set in the editor.
    There are also now some stats in the player, who starts with a power base stat of 6 with a buff of 4 totaling 9 power. When the sword is equipped a further buff of 6 is added to the player power. When sword is re-equipped the buff is properly removed and replaced.
    The weapons are defined by an inventory IWeapon which i should be able to apply to many other types of weapon in the near future. I hope it will be good but it is possible that there are some bugs that won't become obvious untill I am using more varied equipable objects on the final stat list which will be more complex.
    The sword is currently spawned as a child of an empty game object called player hand, in the fnal build this object will be either replaced by or attached to a bone in the player rig.
    The swing of the sword is controlled by the animation state machine and animator which come with unity.
    A handy feature of the unity animator is that aswell as standard transormations you can set key frames for weither or not the collidor for the object is enabled/disabled.
    This makes it very convienent to ensure that the weapon can only trigger collision while it is being swung at someone. This means that the attack has to be triggered in the proper way and users cannot cheat by simply running into the enemy with the sword out in hand.

    The standard fog which was being used before is now accompanied by the global fog script from the standard assets which helps generate fog effect more fully around the screen than before.

    With the aid of a few free low-poly basic assets and some moddeling of my own the base camp from which our hero will set forth on a mighty quest.
    The movement is done using a nav mesh, so pathfinding for our player is quickly and easily calculated. In the future there will be enemies who use the same technique to hunt and kill the player.
    There is also a simple hierarchy here, the demo object types shown are all children of an interactable base class.
    Special thanks to Pavel Mostovschikov who has made avalable an open source mesh which I used as a base for the player charachter models.

    These models have been rigged in mixamo. I never used mixamo before and found it quite a good alternative to my standard rigging process.
    In a relatively short time I had rigs skinned into both models to a standard that would have taken hours the old way. Its a little stretchy in some places so some weights may need to be tweaked to polish it at a later stage.
    Also before I would want to animate directly onto one of these rigs I would add some IK (inverse kinematic) solvers to it for better motion controll.
    I am looking foreward to attempting to intigrate both mixamo animations and some of my own into the game using the mechanim feature which is built into unity to see how they compare.
    However this will have to wait untill a later date untill after higher priority core mechanics are sorted.
    Overall so far I would recomend this service.
