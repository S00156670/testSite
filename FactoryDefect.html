        <p> The game is set in a future world where autonomous drones are responsable for most tasks. Our main charachter is one of these drones and has been pulled off the production lines for QA testing. The little drone must prove to its creators that it can a worthy asset to the outside world by following human commands, defending itself, solving puzzles and learning how to interact with and adapt to its environment aswell as dealing with various other drones (some defective or experamental and others top of the line) which populate the testing arenas.</p>
        <p> Below you can see some early drone designs (left), and a picture of the trophy the game won at "Games Fleadh 2017"</p>
